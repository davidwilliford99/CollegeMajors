# College Majors
*Contributors: David Williford*

### Brief 
Due to an interest in education, this web application is made for those curious about statistics between the different undergraduate university majors (US only). The inspiration for this project was to take a dataset, store it in a Database, then create an API and a frontend to display this information in a user-friendly manner. The primary lessons from this project are the importance of research, documentation and patience.

### Sadly,
Since this web application requires a database that is hosted locally on my machine, you would need me to demo this project for you personally. Feel free to contact me at **WillifordD21@students.ecu.edu** for a demo, or for a copy of the csv file

### Stack Used 
* ReactJS (frontend)
* Java Spring Boot (Backend)
* MySql (Database)
