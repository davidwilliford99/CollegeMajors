# College Majors

## Brief 
This web application is made to view statistics between the different undergraduate university majors from a survey on Kaggle.com. The inspiration for this project was to take a dataset, store it in a Database, then create an API and a frontend to display this information in a user-friendly manner. The primary reason for building this application is to have experience building a simple CRUD app using Spring Boot.


### Tech Used 
* ReactJS (frontend)
* Java Spring Boot (Backend)
* MySql (Database)
